# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description
For this project, I used MapBox API and then manipulated the markers location to show the different stops along a bus route. I created a custom map using MapBox's Style tool. This project used setTimeout to move a marker along given coordinates. I also learned about fetch/await from outside API's. 

## How to Run
If you just want to see the program on your browser, click the following link: https://jorubelle.github.io/realTimeBusTracker/. Click on the blue button in the upper left hand corner to see the marker move! If you want to manipulate the code, clone the repo onto your machine and open it with your text editor of choice. From there you have free reign!

## Roadmap of future Improvements
I would like to add more information about the bus stops by adding a pop up box for each coordinate. I would also like to have the route highlighted like you see on directions from google maps.
